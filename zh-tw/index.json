I remember the excitement of meeting new colleagues, learning new skills, and finding my place in the organization. Over time, I became more confident and began taking on more responsibilities. I was proud of my accomplishments and the impact that I was making.\nHowever, the road was not always easy. There were times when I faced challenges that made me question my abilities and my decisions. I learned that setbacks and failures are a part of the journey, and they can be a source of growth and resilience.\nOne of the most significant moments in my journey was the creation of the Nilvana brand. It was a leap of faith, but I knew that I had a vision that could change the game. With the help of a few dedicated team members, we worked tirelessly to bring the brand to life. Seeing it take off and gain recognition was one of the proudest moments of my career.\nLooking back on my journey, I realize that time truly flies.

By default, USB-FS on Linux systems only allows 16 MB of buffer memory for all USB devices, which may not be sufficient for high-resolution cameras or multiple-camera set ups, resulting in image acquisition issues. To configure USB-FS and increase the buffer memory limit, the following steps should be taken:\nNote that GRUB is for desktop PC architecture. ARM embedded systems use a different bootloader, as GRUB requires a system with a BIOS, and embedded systems do not have one.\nCreate the file /etc/rc.local with the command sudo touch /etc/rc.local.

It all depends on your usage scenario, there is no one-size fit all solution. In this article, we will only focus on on-device inference.\nAt WWDC 2017 Apple released first Core ML. Core ML is Apple’s machine learning framework for doing on-device inference. Core ML is not the only way to do on-device inference, there are tens of libraries and frameworks that are compatible with iOS, but that’s beyond the scope of this article. From the YOLOv7 official repository, we can get the export script to convert trained PyTorch model to Core ML format effortlessly. However, keep one thing in mind, YOLOv7 is a popular open source project, new changes and updates are added very quickly. I’m also very glad to send a PR to improve the export script last night due to this writing 😃.After you got the exported Core ML models, no kidding, you have tons of things in your todo list. Matthijs Hollemans has already written an insightful article in his blog, be sure to checkout and support his efforts! Here is my short list:\nConfigure your Core ML model in a particular way. You can either append NMS to your model or write a lot of additional Swift code. IMHO, this is the most difficult part if you know nothing about the object detection model. Specify camera resolution, don’t simply select the highest resolution available if your app doesn’t require it. Resize or crop your input image to fit network input dimension, it depends on your application. Feed modified images to your model in a correct orientation. Fix Vision’s weird orin. Convert bounding boxes coordinate system for display. This is also a trickier part, you need some iOS development experiences and a pencil for calculation 😎. According to Hollemans’s article, there are at least 5 different coordinate systems you need to take care, not to mention how to handle real-time capturing correctly and efficiently is also non-trivial. You can follow these two articles to learn how to create a custom camera view.\nApple Developer Documentation | Recognizing Objects in Live Capture\nCreating a Custom Camera View | CodePath iOS Cliffnotes At the latest WWDC 2022, Apple introduced even more performance tools to its CoreML toolchain, now you can check your model’s metadata via performance reports and Core ML Instrument without writing any code. You can also use computeUnits = .cpuAndNeuralEngine if you don’t want to use the GPU but always force the model to run on the CPU and ANE if available.\nPrefer CPU and ANE instead of GPU.\nYou can learn more about ANE from the following repository, thank you again Hollemans.\nGitHub - hollance/neural-engine: Everything we actually know about the Apple Neural Engine (ANE)\nHere are snapshots from my model’s performance reports.\nYou can evaluate your model via drag-and-drop image files.\nThere is no significant inference speed differences among quantization models, but the model size only about half the size. It’s a good thing for your mobile applications. No inference speed improved. (Left is FP32, right is FP16)\nHalf the size of the FP32 model.\nFinally, you have a working YOLOv7 Core ML model on the iOS devices, be careful of the heat🔥.

Or an entity that has specific behavior (特定行為). Focus on intention/motivation not implementation This view enables us to build software in two steps:\nMake a preliminary design without worrying about all the details involved. Implement the design. The reason this works is that we only have to focus on the object’s public interface — the communication window through which I ask the object to do something.\nHiding implementations behind interfaces essentially decouples them from the using objects.\nEncapsulation: Traditional view and new view Traditional View data hiding Broad View any kind of hiding Implementations (data, methods..) Drived classes (Encapsulation of type is achieved when there is an abstract class with derivations (or an interface with implementations) that are used polymorphically) Design details Instantiation rules (ex. creational patterns) Advantage It gives us a better way to split up (decompose) our programs. The encapsulating layers become the interfaces we design to. (封裝層成為設計需要遵循的介面)\nBy encapsulating different kinds of subclasses (encapsulation of type), we can add new ones without changing any of the client programs using them. (GoF typically means when they mention encapsulation)\nInheritance Traditional View reuse of classes achived by creating classes and then deriving new (spcialized) classes bases on these base (generalized) classes Broad View using inheritance for specialization, however can cause weak cohesion reduces possibility of reuse does not scale well with variation to classify classes as things that behave the same way. (placeholder) Find What Is Varying and Encapsulate It Consider what should be variable in your design. This approach is the opposite of focusing on the cause of redesign. Instead of considering what might force a change to a design, consider what you want to be able to change without redesign. The focus here is on encapsulating the concept that varies, a theme of many design patterns. \u0026ndash; GoF, Design Patterns\nMore about GoF\u0026rsquo;s Encapsulation Design patterns use inheritance to classify variations in behaviors. Hiding classes with an abstract class or interface — type encapsulation. Containing a reference of this abstract class or interface type (aggregation) hides these derived classes that represent variations in behavior. In effect, many design patterns use encapsulation to create layers between objects. Containing variation in data vs containing variation in behavior Handling variation in data Have a data member that tells me what type of movement my object has. Have two different types of Animals (both derived from the base Animal class) — one for walking and one for flying. Handling variation in behavior with objects Using objects to contain variation in attributes and using objects to contain variation in behavior are very similar. Don\u0026rsquo;t afraid.\nCommonality and Variability Identify where things vary (commonality analysis) and then identify how they vary (variability analysis).\nCommonality analysis is the search for common elements that helps us understand how family members are the same.\nVariability analysis reveals how family members vary. Variability only makes sense within a given commonality.\nEx. Whiteboard marker, pencil, ballpoint pen\nCommonality: writing instrument Variability: material to write, shape.. Commonality and Variability and Abstract class Commonality analysis seeks structure that is unlikely to change over time, while variability analysis captures structure that is likely to change. Variability analysis makes sense only in terms of the context defined by the associated commonality analysis. In other words, if variations are the specific concrete cases in the domain, commonality defines the concepts in the domain that tie them together. The common concepts will be represented by abstract classes. The variations found by variability analysis will be implemented by the concrete classes.\nRelationship between Commonality and Variability, perspectives, and abstract classes Benefits of using abstract classes for specialization Two-Step Procedure for Design Ask yourself:\nWhen defining an abstract class (commonality): What interface is needed to handle all the responsibilities (core concepts from the conceptual perspective) of this class? When defining derived classes: Given this particular implementation (this variation), how can I implement it (variation) with the given specification? Take away Think object-oriented in a broad way.\nObject: an entity that has responsibilities (specific behavior) Encapsulation: any kind of hiding (instantiation rule, type..) Inheritance: use for specialization and classify classes as things that behave the same way. Find what is varying and encapsulate it (in behavior).\nCommonality, variability and abstract class: use inheritance to classify variations in behaviors.\n","permalink":"https://blog.cmwang.net/zh-tw/posts/2017/01/design-patterns-explained-ch8/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"expanding-our-horizons\"\u003eExpanding Our Horizons\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eObject\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEncapsulation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInheritance\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandling variation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCommonality and variability analysis\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAbstract class and its derived classes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"Design Patterns Explained - CH8"},{"content":"Object-Oriented Paradigm Purpose: Explain why object-oriented paradigm over functional decomposition.\nNaive Problem If I were to give you the task of writing code to access a description of shapes that were stored in a database and then display them.\n如果給你一個任務，要編寫一段程式，存取在資料庫中儲存的形狀描述，然後將它顯示出來。\nStructural Programming thinking - possible steps Locate the list of shapes in the database. (在資料庫中找到形狀清單)。 Open up the list of shapes. (打開形狀清單)。 Sort the list according to some rules. (依照某種規則將清單排序)。 Display the individual shapes on the monitor.

Call the appropriate function that will display the shape, giving it the shape’s location. (以形狀的位置為參數，呼叫顯示形狀的 Function)。\nFunctional Decomposition 的挑戰 它通常會導致一個**主**程式負責控制子程式(subprograms)。 這使得主程式所承受的責任太多了：要協調各 subprograms，還要控制他們的順序 (Why not delegation?)。 \u0026laquo;上帝物件：能者多勞\u0026raquo; 如果將實作各步驟的所有邏輯都放在一個大 Function 或大 module 的話，則這些步驟的實質性變化，都必須對這個 Function 或 module 進行修改。 \u0026laquo;因應變化的能力差\u0026raquo; 討論 需求總是在改變 (不變的真理)。 我們可能不知道會發生什麼變化，但我們能夠猜到哪裡會變化。(OO 最大的優點之一，就是可以封裝這些變化區域)。 與其抱怨需要總是改變，不如改變開發流程，有效的因應變化。 Dealing with Changes: Functional Decomposition 4c. Call the appropriate function that will display the shape, giving it the shape’s location. (以形狀的位置為參數，呼叫顯示形狀的 Function)。\nUsing Modularity to Contain Variation\nfunction: display shape input: type of shape, description of shape action: switch (type of shape) case square: put display function for square here case circle: put display function for circle here 討論 如果要顯示一個新的形狀(例如三角形)，我可能只需要改這個模組(希望是)。 這個模組的輸入是 type of shape, description of shape，如果今天使用不同方式提供輸入(例如 array of points 或其他方式)，該怎麼辦？ Functional Decomposition 兩個可能的問題 Weak cohesion (Cohesion refers to how “closely the operations in a routine are related; cohesion as clarity because the more that operations are related in a routine (or a class), the easier it is to understand things.) Tight Coupling (Coupling refers to “the strength of a connection between two routines. Coupling is a complement to cohesion.) The goal is to create routines with internal integrity (strong cohesion) and small, direct, visible, and flexible relations to other routines (loose coupling).\n從日常生活借鏡 You are an instructor at a conference. People in your class have another class to attend following yours, but don’t know where it is located. One of your responsibilities is to make sure everyone knows how to get to the next class.\n你的責任是確保大家知道怎麼去到下一堂課的位置。\n可能的步驟 Get list of people in the class. For each person on this list, do the following: Find the next class he or she is taking. Find the location of that class. Find the way to get from your classroom to the person’s next class. Tell the person how to get to his or her next class. 所以你可能需要這麼做 A way of getting the list of people in the class. A way of getting the schedule for each person in the class. A program that gives someone directions from your classrom to any other classroom. A control program that works for each person in the class and does the reuqired steps for each person. 不! 你應該會這樣做 你可能會把從這個教室到其他教室的路線貼出來，然後告訴所有人：我們已經將下一堂課的地點和其他教室的位置都貼在後面了，請根據它找到你們下一堂課的教室。\nYou would probably post directions to go from this classroom to the other classrooms and then tell everyone in the class, I have posted the locations of the classes following this in the back of the room, as well as the locations of the other classrooms. Please use them to go to your next classroom.\n兩種策略的差別 Giving explicit directions to everyone. Giving general instructions and then expect the each person will figure out how to do the task individually. (責任轉移 delegation) 需求又改變了 如果我被告知，需要給擔任助教工作的學生一些特殊指示。他們可能需要在下一堂課前收集本堂課學生的評價，並且交到辦公室。\n第一種方式，不得不改控制程式，區別研究生跟大學生，然後給研究生特別的指示。 第二種方式，只需要為研究生再編寫一個程式，但控制程式仍然只需要說: 找到你們的下一堂教室。 為什麼有這麼大的差異 人們對自己的行為負責，而不再由一個中央控制程式負責決定。 控制程式可以與不同類型的學生交流(大學生或研究生)。 控制程式不需要知道學生從這個教室到下一個教室可能需要採取的任何特殊步驟。 軟體開發的三種視角 Conceptual: 表示 domain concepts，不管如何實作。回答這個問題：What am I responsibile for? Specification: 關注軟體的 interface，但還是不管如何實作。回答這個問題：How am I used? Implementation: 我們都很熟。回答這個問題： How do I fulfill my responsibilities?\u0026quot; 不同視角的用途 概念層次上的溝通：你告訴學生的是「你要他們怎麼做」，而不是「如何去做」。 (you are telling people what you want, not how to do it.)\n在概念層次上交流，而在另一層次(實作)上執行，這樣講師就不需要知道具體的實作細節。只需要一般性，概念性的知道即可。\n效力：只要概念不變，請求者與實作細節的變化就被隔離開來。\nObject-Oriented Paradigm 使用物件的優點在於，可以定義物件負責自己的事務。\n討論 The objects were identified by looking at the entities in the problem domain. I identified the responsibilities (or methods) for each object by looking at what these entities need to do.\n\u0026ndash; ☆☆☆ 理解物件的最佳方式 ☆☆☆ 將其看為具有責任的東西。物件應該自己負責自己，而且應該清楚地定義責任。\nApply Fowler\u0026rsquo;s Perspectives At the conceptual level, an object is a set of responsibilities. (一組責任) At the specification level, an object is a set of methods (behaviors) that can be invoked by other objects or by itself. (一組行為) At the implementation level, an object is code and data and computational interactions between them. Object-Oriented Approach Start the control program. Instantiate the collection of students in the classroom. Tell the collection to have the students go to their next class. The collection tells each student to go to his or her next class. Each student: Finds where his next class is. Determines how to get there. Goes there. Done. Abstract and Polymorphism Student abstract class, GraduageStudent and RegularStudent classes. Abstract classes define what other, related, classes can do. Abstract classes act as placeholders for other classes. Collection 只需要處理 Student 這個 Concept (Abstract)，每一種 Student 都可以按照自己的方式實作功能 (Concrete)。 當我們透過抽象參考，概念性的要求物件做什麼時，將得到不同的行為，具體行為取決於 Derived Class 的實作。(Polymorphism) 回到一開始的問題 Locate the list of shapes in the database. (在資料庫中找到形狀清單)。 Open up the list of shapes. (打開形狀清單)。 Sort the list according to some rules. (依照某種規則將清單排序)。 Display the individual shapes on the monitor. (在螢幕上顯示各種形狀)。 Object-Oriented Approach (1/2) Object-Oriented Approach (2/2) 主程式建立一個 ShapeDataBase 物件。 主程式要求 database object 找到我感興趣的一組形狀，並且 instantiate 一個保存這些形狀的 collection 物件. 主程式要求 Collection 物件排序所存放的形狀。 主程式要求 Collection 物件顯示形狀。 Collection 物件要求所存放的每個形狀顯示自己。 每個形狀根據形狀種類顯示自己。 需求又改變了 增加新的形狀 (三角形)\n增加一個新的三角形 Concrete Class 在此 Derived Class 實作自己的顯示方法。 更改排序方式\n修改 Collection 的 Sorting algorithm 結果：The object-oriented approach has limited the impact of changing requirements.\n封裝的優點 使用更容易，因為使用者不再需要擔心實作問題 可以在不考慮呼叫者的情況下修改實作 (因為它一開始就不知道物件怎麼實作的 depend on interface, not implementation) The internals of an object are unknown to other objects. (封裝使物件內部行為的變化對其他物件變得透明了 \u0026lt;不可見\u0026gt;)。 Take away 將物件看為具有責任的東西。物件應該自己負責自己，而且應該清楚地定義責任。 物件真正的威力不在於繼承，而是來自於封裝行為(採取更廣義的封裝定義)。 OO 最大的優點之一，就是可以封裝這些變化區域。 抽象與責任轉嫁的好處 (placeholder and delegation)。 三種視角的應用 (在抽象層次上溝通，在實作層次上執行)。 ","permalink":"https://blog.cmwang.net/zh-tw/posts/2017/01/design-patterns-explained-ch1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"object-oriented-paradigm\"\u003eObject-Oriented Paradigm\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurpose: Explain why object-oriented paradigm over functional decomposition.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Design Patterns Explained - CH1"},{"content":"Resources [Design Pattern]資源總整理 UML 軟件工程組織 圖說設計模式 真 OO 无双 之 真乱舞书 Source Making Best Practice Software Engineering 白話 Rock 的系統開發雜記 .Net 蛤什麼? 非關語言: 設計模式 OO Design Object-Oriented Software Engineering Go 言語での構造體実裝パターン Cloud Design Patterns: Prescriptive Architecture Guidance for Cloud Applications ","permalink":"https://blog.cmwang.net/zh-tw/posts/2017/01/design-patterns-resources/","summary":"一些設計模式的連結，年代有點久了，不是很值得參考了","title":"設計模式學習資源"}]
